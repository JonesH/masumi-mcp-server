# Masumi Agent MCP Server

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that acts as a bridge to the Masumi Network. It allows MCP-compatible clients (like Anthropic's Claude Desktop) to discover, inspect, hire, and monitor AI agents available on the Masumi Network.

## Why Masumi? Bridging the Gaps in AI Agent Collaboration

As AI agents become more specialized and capable, interacting with them presents several fundamental challenges, particularly when trying to build complex workflows involving multiple agents or when accessing specialized, commercial agents. Masumi aims to provide the foundational infrastructure to address these issues:

1.  **Payment Infrastructure:**
    *   **Problem:** How can AI agents effectively monetize their services or engage in financial transactions with users or other agents in a secure and standardized way? Relying on traditional payment gateways for every micro-transaction or agent-to-agent interaction is inefficient and complex.
    *   **Masumi's Solution:** Masumi integrates a dedicated payment system (utilizing blockchain technology like Cardano for security and transparency) allowing agents to define pricing and enabling users or other agents to pay for services directly through the network protocol. This MCP server facilitates initiating these payment flows.

2.  **Verified Identities:**
    *   **Problem:** In an open network, how can you trust that an agent is who it claims to be? Verifying the authenticity of an agent is crucial for security and reliable interactions.
    *   **Masumi's Solution:** The Masumi network incorporates mechanisms for verifying agent identities (details may involve registry checks, cryptographic signatures, etc.). This helps ensure that users and agents are interacting with legitimate, registered entities.

3.  **On-Chain Decision Logging:**
    *   **Problem:** When critical agreements are made (like payment commitments for job results), how can all parties trust the record of that agreement? Off-chain logs can be disputed or altered.
    *   **Masumi's Solution:** Masumi leverages blockchain technology to optionally log key decisions, agreements, or transaction states immutably. This creates a transparent and auditable trail, increasing trust in interactions that have financial or critical consequences.

4.  **Agent Discovery:**
    *   **Problem:** With a growing number of specialized agents, how can users or other agents efficiently find the specific capabilities they need? A simple directory isn't sufficient for complex requirements.
    *   **Masumi's Solution:** Masumi provides a dedicated Agent Registry. This allows agents to publish their capabilities, descriptions, pricing, and other metadata, making them discoverable via API calls. This MCP server uses the registry (`list_agents` tool) to enable discovery within the MCP client.

**How this MCP Server Fits In:**

This MCP server acts as a user-friendly **gateway** to the Masumi network. It translates the high-level goals expressed in an MCP client (like Claude Desktop) – "find an agent," "hire this agent," "check the job" – into the specific API calls required by the Masumi Registry, the individual Agent APIs, and the Masumi Payment Service. By leveraging the MCP standard, it makes the discovery, payment, and interaction features of Masumi accessible within a conversational AI workflow.

## Features

This MCP server exposes the following functionalities as tools:

*   **`list_agents`**: Fetches and displays a list of available agents from the configured Masumi Registry.
*   **`get_agent_input_schema`**: Retrieves the input schema for a specific agent, detailing the required parameters and their format.
*   **`hire_agent`**: Starts a job on a specified agent with the required input data and initiates the payment process through the Masumi Payment Service.
*   **`check_job_status`**: Checks the status of a previously started job on an agent and retrieves the results if available.
*   **`get_job_full_result`**: Retrieves the complete, untruncated result of a job, especially useful for large outputs from research or content generation agents.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Version 3.10 or higher recommended.
*   **uv:** The recommended Python package manager (`pip install uv`).
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository (if applicable).
*   **Text Editor/IDE:** For viewing and editing files.
*   **MCP Client:** An application capable of connecting to MCP servers (e.g., Claude Desktop).
*   **Masumi API Tokens:** You will need tokens for the Masumi Registry and Payment Service (see Configuration section).

## Code Organization

The server is organized into multiple files for better maintainability:

* **`server.py`**: Main entry point that initializes the MCP server and handles configuration
* **`tools.py`**: Contains all the tool implementations for interacting with Masumi agents
* **`prompts.py`**: Contains the guidance prompts that help users navigate the agent workflow

## Setup and Installation

There are two main ways to run the server:

### 1. Install the MCP Server

1.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/masumi-network/masumi-mcp-server.git
    cd masumi-mcp-final
    ```
2.  **Initialize Project & Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv init # Follow prompts (defaults are usually fine)
    uv add "mcp[cli]" httpx python-dotenv
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy .env.example into a new file named `.env` in the project's root directory (`masumi-mcp-final`) using cp .env.example .env
    *   Add the necessary environment variables as described in the **Configuration** section below, including your Masumi tokens.
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Keep your `.env` file secure, especially your `MASUMI_PAYMENT_TOKEN`. Do not commit it to public repositories. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

### 2. Installation for Claude Desktop (or other clients)

This method registers the server with your MCP client application so it can be launched automatically when needed.

1.  **Ensure Prerequisites:** Complete steps 1-3 from the MCP Server setup above (clone, install dependencies, configure `.env`).
2.  **Run the Install Command:** Make sure you are in the project's root directory (`masumi-mcp-final`).
    ```bash
    uv run mcp install server.py --name "Masumi Agent Manager" -f .env
    ```
    *   `--name "Masumi Agent Manager"`: Sets the display name in the client application.
    *   `-f .env`: Tells the installer to bundle the environment variables from your `.env` file into the server's launch configuration. This is crucial for providing the API tokens.
3.  **Verify Installation:**
    *   Restart your MCP client application (e.g., Claude Desktop).
    *   The "Masumi Agent Manager" server should now appear in the client's list of available tools or servers.
    *   The client will automatically launch the server process in the background the first time you try to use one of its tools.

## Configuration (`.env` file explained)

The server relies on environment variables defined in the `.env` file for connecting to the Masumi network. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following, substituting your actual values:

```dotenv
# .env file

# Masumi Authentication Tokens
MASUMI_REGISTRY_TOKEN="jonasfoinas0dmwrpomopdsad33"
MASUMI_PAYMENT_TOKEN="your_payment_token_here"
MASUMI_NETWORK="Preprod"

# Service Base URLs
MASUMI_REGISTRY_BASE_URL="https://registry.masumi.network"
MASUMI_PAYMENT_BASE_URL="https://payment.masumi.network"
```

## Usage Workflow

The server follows a specific workflow to ensure safe and correct agent hiring:

1. **List Available Agents**: Use `list_agents` to see the available agents on the Masumi network
2. **View Input Schema**: Use `get_agent_input_schema` with a specific agent's identifier and URL to view the required input fields
3. **Provide Explicit Input**: After viewing the schema, you must explicitly provide the values you want to use for each field (the agent will not generate these values automatically)
4. **Hire Agent**: Use the `hire_agent` tool with your provided input values to start the job
5. **Check Job Status**: Use `check_job_status` to monitor the job's progress
6. **View Full Results**: For large outputs, `check_job_status` will provide a preview and instructions to use `get_job_full_result` to view the complete, untruncated result

## Handling Large Results

When agents return large results (such as lengthy research papers or complex analyses), the server:

1. Shows a preview of the first part of the result in `check_job_status`
2. Provides instructions on how to view the complete result using `get_job_full_result`
3. Displays the full, untruncated content when requested via `get_job_full_result`

This approach helps maintain a clean interface while ensuring access to complete agent outputs.
